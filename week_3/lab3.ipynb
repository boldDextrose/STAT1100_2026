    "From here, we will cover some optional material that is not required to understand this course,\n",
    "but will improve your understanding of python programming. To complete this, you cannot use a\n",
    "jupyter notebook, you must use a text-editor/IDE.\n",
    "\n",
    "By now, you have probably heard of the terms \"library\", \"module\", and \"package\" used almost\n",
    "interchangeably. They all have subtle differences that will be clear in a moment, but at the same\n",
    "time they all share a purpose, collecting code for easier reuse and readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set-up\n",
    "\n",
    "For this Section we will need to first create a folder called \"lab3\", we will then add files and\n",
    "folders to this folder. You will need to use a text editor to create any Python files, ensure that\n",
    "they get saved with the extension \".py\" noting that some text editors might add \".txt\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of text editor is up to you. Notably, most lab computers would have notepad++ by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a Module\n",
    "\n",
    "A module is a Python file that is independent of the file which your are running your\n",
    "main code. That module can then be \"imported\" into the main code to make it's functions,\n",
    "variables, etc. available. We will see what this means with the following example, where we will construct\n",
    "a module called \"stats\" which will perform a mean on a collection of numbers stored in our\n",
    "main file.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will create the module by creating a file called \"stats.py\" in the lab3 folder.\n",
    "In this file we will write the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "An assortment of basic statistics functions\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def mean(numbers):\n",
    "    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first three lines of that code are an optional \"docstring\" which is a special type of comment\n",
    "that provides documentation for what it is attached to. In this case, the docstring is attached to\n",
    "the module to provide a description of its purpose, you can also put them on functions,\n",
    "classes, variables, etc. Including docstrings ensures that when you call the `help` function\n",
    "on the module, function, etc. you will see that documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will create our main file, where we will import and use the module. The main file\n",
    "will be called \"main.py\" and will also be in the lab3 folder, it will contain the following\n",
    "code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import stats\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "    print(stats.mean(numbers))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line of the code imports our module `stats` into the \"namespace\" called `stats`. A namespace\n",
    "is similar to a variable, but it collects the variables, functions, and classes inside modules, each of\n",
    "which can be accessed with `namespace.variable_function_etc`. The next notable line is the `if __name__ == \"__main__\"`\n",
    "line which is not required, but is a good practice to include. What it does is ensure that the code contained\n",
    "in the if block is only executed if this is the main file that is executed. That means that if you import main,\n",
    "that code will not be executed. Finally, we call the `mean` function from the `stats` namespace on our list of numbers\n",
    "and print the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "To execute this file, you can use the command `python main.py` from the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add a function called `std` to the `stats` which computes the standard deviation of a list of numbers.\n",
    "Call it on the numbers list in the main file.\n",
    "2. Print the results of calling `dir` on the `stats` module.\n",
    "3. Add docstrings to both of the functions in the `stats` module. Then, in the main file, call the help\n",
    "function on the module and each of those functions. (press q to exit the help function)\n",
    "4. Create a module called `functions` and add in two functions, $f(x) = x^2 + 3$ and $f(x) = x^3 + 5$.\n",
    "Then, in the main file, import the `functions` module and call the two functions on $4$. Print the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Collecting Modules into a Library\n",
    "\n",
    "A library is collection of modules, they create an additional namespace for the modules better sorting them.\n",
    "Now that we have two modules, we can create a library that we will call `lib`. To do this, we will create\n",
    "a folder called \"lib\" and move \"stats.py\" and \"functions.py\" into this folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to import the modules into our main file, we will need to replace `import stats` with `from lib import stats`\n",
    "and `import functions` with `from lib import functions`. This is due to our added namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also make `lib` directly contain the modules. We just need to add a file called `__init__.py` to the the `lib`\n",
    "folder, it will contain:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from . import stats\n",
    "from . import functions\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the `from .` means take the module from this folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this file, we can now simplify the imports of our main file to:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import lib\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "    print(lib.stats.mean(numbers))\n",
    "    # etc.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this form of import gives us a two level namespace, `lib.module.variable_function_etc`. The reason these namespaces\n",
    "are important outside of sorting code, is that they allows us to not worry about overwritng variables, functions, etc. from other\n",
    "modules. This also happens to determine the level which we should import from. For example, since there is nothing else in\n",
    "`main.py` called `stats`, we can import `stats` from `lib` with `from lib import stats` and not worry about overwriting it\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a another library called `strings`. Inside `strings` create two modules, `words` and `letters`. In `words`\n",
    "create a functions called `count` which takes a string and returns the number of words in the string, also create\n",
    "a function called `reverse` which reverses the string. In `letters`, create a function called `count` which finds\n",
    "the number of letters in a string. In the main file, call each of these functions on a string and print the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Then, What is a Package?\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, this takes us to packages. A package is simply a library that is built so it can be imported into Python from\n",
    "any folder, they appear as an extending feature for Python. We commonly use packages built by other people to make our own\n",
    "code simpler, and to prevent us from \"reinventing the wheel\". The `pip` tool that is a part of the Python distribution is\n",
    "used to manage and install packages, of which usually come from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/)."
